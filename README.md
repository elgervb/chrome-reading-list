# MY READING LIST
Google Chrome Extension to keep track of your readinglist. Add pages or links to your readinglist for later reading with a single right click or from the + icon in the popup.
Review your readinglist from the extension popup in the top right corner of your screen.
When signed in, the readinglist will be synced to your account, so you can use it on other devices as well.

Read an item by clicking on the item in the popup. This will remove the item from the list, reducing the length of the readinglist with each dlick.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me. You can contact me through the support section of this plugin in the Chrome web store.

NOTE: this extension is free of charge and does not contain any ads.

Permission needed for:
- bookmarks: we store all reading list items in a separate bookmarks folder. This will also enable auto syncing when signing into Chrome
- tabs: when adding a reading list item, we need to read the url and the title of the active tab
- contextMenus: to add My reading list => Add bookmark context menu on right click


## Add reading list bookmark
The extension adds a context menu item to the page, which enables you to add a new bookmark to the readinglist.
Just right click on the page you want to add, and select:

![My reading list icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elgervb/chrome-reading-list/master/src/assets/icon16.png) My reading list => Add bookmark

Alternatively, you can also bookmark links on the current page. Right click on a link and use the context menu to add it to the list.

## Manage reading list bookmarks

In the taskbar, right of the address bar, you'll find the extension icon _![My reading list icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elgervb/chrome-reading-list/master/src/assets/icon16.png) My reading list => Add bookmark_.
Clicking on it reveals the list with all items in the reading list.
Clicking on an item will open it in the current tab and removes it from the list.
