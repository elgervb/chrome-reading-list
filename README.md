# MY READING LIST
Google Chrome Extension to keep track of your readinglist. Add pages or links to your readinglist for later reading with a single right click.
Review your readinglist from the extension popup in the top right corner of your screen.
When signed in, the readinglist will be synced to your account, so you can use it on other devices as well.

## Add reading list bookmark
The extension adds a context menu item to the page, which enables you to add a new bookmark to the readinglist.
Just right click on the page you want to add, and select:

![My reading list icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elgervb/chrome-reading-list/master/src/assets/icon16.png) My reading list => Add bookmark

Alternatively, you can also bookmark links on the current page. Right click on a link and use the context menu to add it to the list.
